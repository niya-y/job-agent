Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Data Engineer position. With over 5 years of experience building scalable data infrastructure and a proven track record of optimizing ETL pipelines, I am confident I can contribute to your team's success from day one.

At Tech Corp, I led the redesign of our data warehouse architecture, reducing query times by 60% and saving $50K annually in compute costs. I implemented a real-time streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spark that now processes over 10 million events daily with 99.9% uptime. My work enabled the data science team to deploy ML models 3x faster than before.

Previously at Startup Inc, I built the company's first automated ETL system using Python and Airflow, which eliminated 20 hours of manual work weekly. I also mentored two junior engineers who have since become key contributors to the team.

I am particularly drawn to your company's mission of democratizing data access. My experience in building self-service analytics platforms aligns perfectly with your goal of empowering business users to make data-driven decisions.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in distributed systems and passion for data infrastructure can benefit your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards
```
